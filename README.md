# HiddenMarkovNeuralNetwork

An hybrid between HMM and Neural networks for sequential training and time series forecasting. In this repository we display some tutorials on how to use HMNN in different scenarios. 

## Requirements for the tutorials

- FLAG-example. In "FLAG-example.ipynb" we explains how to run an HMNN for video frame prediction.
  You require the libraries:
  * cv2
  * torch (PyTorch)
  * random
  * sklearn
  * matplotlib
  * numpy
  * pickle: this is use only for saving and loading files

- MNIST_evolvingClassifier-example. In "MNIST_evolving_classifier-example.ipynb" we explains how to use 
  HMNN with an evolving classifier on MNIST. We also show how to build the dataset.
  You require the following libraries:
  * gzip
  * torch (PyTorch)
  * random
  * sklearn
  * matplotlib
  * numpy
  * pickle: this is use only for saving and loading files

- MNIST-variationalDropConnect. In "MNIST_variational_dropconnect-example.ipynb" we explains how to use 
  HMNN with Variational DropConnect in MNIST.
  You require the following libraries:
  * gzip
  * torch (PyTorch)
  * random
  * sklearn
  * matplotlib
  * numpy
  * pickle: this is use only for saving and loading files
